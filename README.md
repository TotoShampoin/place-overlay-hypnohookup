# r/Place Overlay User Script

## Introduction

This is a [userScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/userScripts), which is basically just an extra peice of Javascript placed into a website designed to manipulate the page or add new features. What this userScript will do is to activate when on Reddit's [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place) subreddit, scan the area where the overlay is looking to compare the tiles to a desired image, then alter the appearance of those tiles to show a smaller square within the tile of the correct color that tile should be to be a copy of the image provided. Basically, it's an overlay to help groups maintain an accurate image on r/place.

**Public Service Announcement**: you should always be careful when using unknown scripts from the internet. Forunately the functionality of this script is fairly simple so it's easy to see that all it's doing is comparing an image with r/place tiles' colors and not tracking you or something nefarious like that, but you should check on that yourself, including this script.
